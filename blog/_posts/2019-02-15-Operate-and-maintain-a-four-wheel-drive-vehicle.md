“RIIVEH305E - Operate and maintain a four wheel drive vehicle” is a unit describing the skills and knowledge required to operate and maintain a four wheel drive vehicle in the resource industry.
The significant volume of off-road driving required in mining and exploration, often in remote areas, means completion of this course is mandatory to work in many exploration companies.

  <br> 
This two-day course is delivered through a combination of lectures and practical demonstrations/assessments. In addition to focusing on skills specific to four-wheel drive vehicles, the course also emphasizes safety and covers some defensive driving techniques.

I participated in this training at Drive Safe Australia’s facility in the Serpentine Valley. I was highly impressed by Drive Safe Australia’s demonstrators, who exceptionally knowledgeable and friendly. 
Practical components of the course included pre-start vehicle checks, wheel changes, snatch-strap vehicle recovery, emergency braking, driving in sand and hill climbing. Solutions to transmission wind up and considerations for driving on variable terrain (such as adjusting tyre pressures for specific driving conditions) were also discussed.

I would highly recommend that geologists gain the RIIVEH305E certification. As a result of Drive Safe Australia’s instruction, my confidence with off-road driving has improved. Further, I have acquired an appreciation for the recreational value of 4X4 vehicles. The 2019 Suzuki Jimny now looks like a particularly tempting car…
